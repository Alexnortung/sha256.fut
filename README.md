# SHA256 library for futhark

This library provides functions for running the sha256 algorithm in futhark.
The performance is very low compared to other programs (see benchmarks)

## Getting started

Install the package

```bash
$ futhark pkg add github.com/alexnortung/sha256.fut
```

## Benchmarks

These benchmarks has been run on an AMD Radeon 6700 RX XT

```bash
$ futhark bench --backend=opencl lib/github.com/alexnortung/sha256.fut/main.fut
```

| Number of hashes | Time (Âµ) | Hashes per second |

| 24000000         | 1016341  | 23,614,121.64     |

The best performance was when doing 16 million hashes in a batch with a performance of 107 MH/s (mega hashes) per second

Benchmarks has also been obtained from hashcat with the sha256 algorithm, on the same system.
It had a performance of 5154.0 MH/s, which is significantly higher than this library

```bash
$ hashcat -b -m 1470
```
